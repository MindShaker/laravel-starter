# How to install

## Prerequisites

To begin, you'll need a **fresh** install of Laravel. **Adding this to an 
existing project is not recommended and may cause issues**. For full 
instructions on installing Laravel, refer to the 
[Laravel installation docs](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation), but 
something like the following will get you up and running:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

cd example-app
```

## Installing base project with breeze and UiKit

# TODO
```

```
