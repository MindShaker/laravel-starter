# Laravel Starter with Uikit

**Atention:** This package was updated to not only install Uikit scaffolding but also allow to keep tailwind and Alpine JS. 

This package installs the starter kit "[Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze-installation)" and styles it with [UiKit](https://getuikit.com/) and it removes unnecessary files from Breeze and tailwind (See the full list of deleted / changed files below).

Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To begin, you'll need a **fresh** install of Laravel. **Adding this to an 
existing project is not recommended and may cause issues**. For full 
instructions on installing Laravel, refer to the 
[Laravel installation docs](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation), but 
something like the following will get you up and running:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

cd example-app
```

### Installing

1. Include this repository into your composer dependencies:
```
composer require mindshaker/laravel-uikit
```
OR
```
composer require mindshaker/laravel-starter
```

2. Run the artisan command to install Breeze and UIKit (This will delete / change files. Please see full list below.) Or keep tailwind and insert a default design system
```
php artisan starter:install
```

3. Finish the Breeze installation
```
php artisan migrate

npm install
```
